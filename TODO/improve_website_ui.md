# Task: Improve Website UI/UX to Reflect Expert-Level Developer Skills

## Description
The current website interface is basic and lacks visual appeal and modern UI/UX elements. The goal is to redesign and re-implement key parts of the UI to showcase a higher level of design and frontend development expertise, reflecting the skills of an expert-level developer. This includes improving aesthetics, responsiveness, and user experience.

## Proposed Solution

This task will involve a multi-faceted approach, focusing on key areas of UI/UX design and modern frontend development practices.

#### 1. Design Principles & Aesthetic Goals
*   **Clean & Modern:** Emphasize a minimalist, clean design with good use of whitespace.
*   **Professional & Polished:** High-quality typography, consistent color palette, and subtle animations.
*   **Responsive:** Ensure a seamless experience across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*   **User-Centric:** Intuitive navigation and clear presentation of information.
*   **Accessible (A11y):** Adhere to WCAG guidelines, ensuring usability for all users, including those with disabilities.

#### 2. Key Areas for Improvement
*   **Homepage (`src/routes/+page.svelte`):**
    *   Enhance the hero section with a more engaging layout, potentially including a subtle background animation or a more dynamic presentation of name/title.
    *   Introduce sections for "About Me," "Skills," and "Featured Projects" with visually appealing components.
*   **Navigation (`src/lib/components/Nav/Nav.svelte`):**
    *   Refine the navigation bar for better aesthetics and responsiveness, possibly adding hover effects or a subtle sticky behavior.
*   **Global Styles (`src/app.css`, `src/tailwind.css`):**
    *   Review and refine the global typography and color palette to align with the new aesthetic goals.
    *   Ensure consistent spacing and sizing using Tailwind CSS utilities.
*   **Component Library (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Consider integrating a headless UI component library (e.g., `shadcn/ui` for Svelte, if available, or `Radix UI` principles) to build accessible and well-designed components. This demonstrates attention to detail and best practices.

#### 3. Technical Implementation Considerations
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Leverage Tailwind CSS extensively for styling, ensuring consistency and rapid development.
*   **SvelteKit Features:** Utilize SvelteKit's routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and component architecture effectively.
*   **Animations:** Implement subtle, performant animations using Svelte's built-in transitions or a library like `Framer Motion` (if compatible with Svelte).
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Ensure all new UI elements are accessible, following WCAG guidelines (e.g., proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).

#### 4. Component Reusability & Mini Design System
*   All new UI components will be designed and implemented with reusability in mind.
*   Focus on creating atomic components (e.g., buttons, cards, input fields) that can be combined to build more complex UI sections.
*   Establish clear component APIs (props, events, slots) to facilitate easy integration and maintenance.
*   Organize components logically within `src/lib/components/` to form a nascent "design system" that can be expanded upon.

## Steps

1.  **Define Color Palette and Typography:**
    *   Based on the "UI/UX Design Guidelines" in my internal knowledge, propose a specific color palette (primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic) and font choices.
    *   Update `tailwind.config.ts` and `src/app.css` accordingly.
2.  **Redesign Homepage Hero Section:**
    *   Modify `src/routes/+page.svelte` to implement a more visually appealing hero section. This might involve new layout, typography, and potentially a subtle background element.
3.  **Implement "About Me" Section:**
    *   Add a new section to `src/routes/+page.svelte` or a new component (`src/lib/components/About.svelte`) to present a brief "About Me" with improved visual design.
4.  **Implement "Skills" Section:**
    *   Add a new section/component to showcase key technical skills using visually engaging elements (e.g., skill tags, progress bars, or icons).
5.  **Implement "Featured Projects" Section:**
    *   Add a new section/component to highlight a few key projects with a clean, card-based layout, including project titles, descriptions, and links.
6.  **Refine Navigation Bar:**
    *   Modify `src/lib/components/Nav/Nav.svelte` to enhance its visual design and responsiveness.
7.  **Review and Refine Global Styles:**
    *   Perform a holistic review of `src/app.css` and `src/tailwind.css` to ensure consistency and adherence to the new design principles.
8.  **Add Responsiveness:**
    *   Ensure all new and modified components are fully responsive across different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities.

## Verification

*   The website exhibits a professional, modern, and polished aesthetic.
*   Key sections (hero, about, skills, projects) are visually engaging and well-structured.
*   The website is fully responsive and provides a good user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
*   The UI reflects attention to detail in typography, spacing, and color.
*   The overall design showcases expert-level frontend development and UI/UX skills.
