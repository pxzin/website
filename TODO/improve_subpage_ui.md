# Task: Improve UI/UX of About, Projects, and Contact Routes

## Description
Enhance the visual design and user experience of the `/about`, `/projects`, and `/contact` routes to align with the new aesthetic and development principles established for the homepage. Ensure consistency, responsiveness, and a professional presentation of content.

## Proposed Solution

This task will involve applying the established design principles (clean, modern, professional, responsive, accessible) and leveraging the new color palette and typography.

#### 1. General Approach for Subpages
*   **Consistent Layout:** Use a consistent container width and padding for content sections across all subpages.
*   **Clear Headings:** Ensure page titles and section headings are prominent and styled consistently.
*   **Readability:** Optimize typography for readability, especially for longer text content.
*   **Responsiveness:** Design for mobile-first and ensure layouts adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

#### 2. Specific Route Improvements

*   **`/about` Route (`src/routes/about/+page.svelte`):**
    *   Enhance the presentation of the "About" content. This might involve breaking up long paragraphs, adding subtle visual elements, or using a multi-column layout for key information.
    *   Ensure the tone and content reflect a professional and engaging personal narrative.
*   **`/projects` Route (`src/routes/projects/+page.svelte`):**
    *   The current content needs to be styled to match the "Featured Projects" section on the homepage.
    *   Implement a clean, card-based layout for each project, similar to the homepage's featured projects, but potentially with more detail or a dedicated project page link.
    *   Ensure project details (title, description, technologies, links) are clearly presented.
*   **`/contact` Route (`src/routes/contact/+page.svelte`):**
    *   Improve the visual design of the contact form (if present) or contact information.
    *   Ensure clear calls to action for contacting.
    *   Consider adding social media links with appropriate icons.

## Steps

1.  **Review Current Content:**
    *   Read the content of `src/routes/about/+page.svelte`, `src/routes/projects/+page.svelte`, and `src/routes/contact/+page.svelte` to understand the existing information.
2.  **Implement `/about` Route UI:**
    *   Modify `src/routes/about/+page.svelte` to apply the new design principles, focusing on layout, typography, and visual appeal.
3.  **Implement `/projects` Route UI:**
    *   Modify `src/routes/projects/+page.svelte` to present projects in a card-based layout, consistent with the homepage's design.
4.  **Implement `/contact` Route UI:**
    *   Modify `src/routes/contact/+page.svelte` to enhance the presentation of contact information or form.
5.  **Ensure Responsiveness:**
    *   Verify that all changes are fully responsive across different screen sizes.

## Verification

*   The `/about`, `/projects`, and `/contact` routes are visually appealing and consistent with the overall website design.
*   Content on these pages is well-presented and easy to read.
*   All pages are fully responsive.
*   The UI reflects attention to detail and professional frontend development.
