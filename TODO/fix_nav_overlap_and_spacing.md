# Task: Fix Navigation Bar Overlap and Spacing

## Description
The fixed navigation bar is overlapping with page titles and content on all routes, especially noticeable on the changelog page. This task aims to introduce appropriate spacing below the navigation bar to prevent overlap and improve overall layout and readability.

## Proposed Solution

The issue arises because the navigation bar is `fixed` and takes itself out of the normal document flow, causing subsequent content to flow underneath it. We need to add padding or margin to the main content area to account for the navigation bar's height.

#### 1. Determine Navigation Bar Height
*   The navigation bar has a fixed height due to its padding and content. We need to determine this height to apply appropriate spacing.

#### 2. Apply Spacing to Main Content Area
*   The most effective way to apply consistent spacing across all routes is to add top padding to the `<slot />` element in `src/routes/+layout.svelte`, or to a wrapper around the `<slot />`. This ensures all page content starts below the navigation bar.

## Steps

1.  **Measure Navigation Bar Height:**
    *   Visually inspect the rendered navigation bar in the browser's developer tools to determine its computed height.
2.  **Apply Top Padding to Layout Slot:**
    *   Modify `src/routes/+layout.svelte` to add a `padding-top` to the main content area (the `<slot />` or a wrapper around it) that matches or slightly exceeds the navigation bar's height. Use a Tailwind CSS utility class (e.g., `pt-20` for ~80px).
3.  **Test All Routes:**
    *   Verify that the spacing is correct on the homepage, about, projects, contact, and changelog routes.
    *   Ensure no new overlaps or excessive spacing issues are introduced.

## Verification

*   The navigation bar no longer overlaps with page titles or content on any route.
*   All page content starts with appropriate spacing below the navigation bar.
*   The overall layout and readability of the website are improved.
