# Task: Fix To-Do List Data Storage on Vercel

## Description
The file-based to-do list is failing in the Vercel production environment because the serverless function cannot write to the file system. This task aims to replace the file-based data storage with a solution that is compatible with Vercel's serverless environment.

## Proposed Solution

Since we cannot write to the local file system on Vercel, we need to use a different data storage solution. Given the constraint of not wanting a traditional backend, we can explore serverless-friendly storage options.

#### 1. Vercel KV (Key-Value Store)
*   Vercel offers a serverless key-value store, Vercel KV, which is built on top of Redis. This is an excellent option for storing simple data like a to-do list.
*   We would need to set up a Vercel KV store and connect to it from our SvelteKit application.

#### 2. Other Serverless Databases
*   We could also consider other serverless database options like Supabase, Firebase Realtime Database, or a free-tier cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, PlanetScale). However, these might be overkill for a simple to-do list and might introduce more complexity than desired.

Given the simplicity of the to-do list and the fact that the project is hosted on Vercel, **Vercel KV is the most appropriate and straightforward solution.**

## Steps

1.  **Set up Vercel KV Store:**
    *   In the Vercel dashboard, create a new KV store for the project.
    *   Obtain the necessary environment variables for connecting to the KV store (e.g., `KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`).
2.  **Install Vercel KV Client:**
    *   Install the `@vercel/kv` package to interact with the KV store.
3.  **Update To-Do List Server-Side Logic:**
    *   Modify `src/routes/tools/todolist/+page.server.ts` to use the Vercel KV client instead of `fs`.
    *   The `load` function will read to-do items from the KV store.
    *   The `add` and `delete` actions will write to the KV store.
4.  **Configure Environment Variables on Vercel:**
    *   Add the Vercel KV environment variables to the project's settings on Vercel.
5.  **Test Locally:**
    *   Run the application locally, ensuring it can connect to the Vercel KV store (this might require setting up local environment variables).
    *   Verify that the to-do list functionality works as expected.
6.  **Deploy to Vercel:**
    *   Commit the changes and push to a new branch.
    *   Deploy this branch to Vercel to see if the to-do list works correctly.

## Verification

*   The to-do list is functional in the Vercel production environment.
*   Users can add and delete to-do items, and the changes are persisted.
*   No more file system errors in the Vercel logs.
